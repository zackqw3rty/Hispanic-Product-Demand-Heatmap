# Hispanic Demographic & Product Demand Mapper

## 📌 Overview
This project identifies ZIP codes across select regions with high Hispanic population density and evaluates the correlation with potential demand for culturally significant food products. The goal is to support strategic retail placement and regional sales targeting based on data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Purpose
To build a simple yet powerful tool that:
- Maps Hispanic population concentration by ZIP code
- Cross-references population data with grocery retail store locations
- Highlights high-potential regions for product demand
- Outputs actionable insights for market expansion and sales strategy

## 📂 Features
- ✅ Census data ingestion and cleaning
- ✅ Visualization of demographic clusters (via Plotly or Folium)
- ✅ Basic demand estimation model using population-to-store proximity
- ✅ Exportable tables of high-opportunity ZIP codes
- ⏳ Future: Store-level revenue correlation and predictive modeling

## 📊 Data Sources
- [U.S. Census Bureau ACS 5-Year Estimates](https://www.census.gov/data.html)
- [ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-areas/zctas.html)
- Retail store location data (manually sourced or scraped)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, GeoPandas, Plotly/Folium, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Optional: Flask or Streamlit (for dashboard MVP)

## 📈 Outputs
- Interactive maps showing ZIP code demand hotspots
- Ranked CSV tables of ZIP codes by demand potential
- Plots and graphs for data storytelling

## 🧠 Why It Matters
Cultural relevance and accessibility drive food purchase behavior. By identifying the right regions, brands can:
- Increase revenue through smarter placement
- Serve communities more authentically
- Reduce risk and waste in logistics and marketing
